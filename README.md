# Integrated-Analysis-of-AMD
> This is the raw code for paper "Integrated Analysis of DNA Methylation and Transcriptome Profile to identify Key Features of Age-related Macular Degeneration".
The raw data of transcriptome were downloaded from GSE135092[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi].
And the raw data of DNA methylation were downloaded from E-MTAB-7183[https://www.ebi.ac.uk/arrayexpress/experiments/E-MTAB-7183/].
This study contains two part of R code-transcriptome and DNA methylation.

Please run code in transcritpome folder first, and then DNA methylation step by step.
